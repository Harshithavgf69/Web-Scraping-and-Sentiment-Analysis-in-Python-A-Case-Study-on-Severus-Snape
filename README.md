# Web-Scraping-and-Sentiment-Analysis-in-Python-A-Case-Study-on-Severus-Snape
By Harshitha Reddy
I started watching Harry Potter because a friend wouldnâ€™t stop recommending it. One movie night turned into a tradition, laughing at the same jokes, quoting lines, and getting way too invested in house rivalries. Itâ€™s been our little ritual ever since, and honestly, it never gets old.

But how does this fit into my puzzle?

Businesses crave the why behind customer behavior and thatâ€™s where I come in! Imagine this:

âœ¨ Want to know how customers really feel about your product? Iâ€™ll scrape reviews, analyze emotions, and boom! youâ€™ve got a magic potion of insights to make it better.
âœ¨ Drowning in social media chaos? No worries I can cut through the noise and reveal what people are actually saying.
âœ¨ Stuck in a marketing slump? Iâ€™ll decode the words that truly click with your audience, casting spells of connection and boosting your brand.
Because behind every click, comment, and complaintâ€¦ there's a story waiting to be told. Letâ€™s continue this journey!

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The goal? To unravel the emotional mysteries of Professor Snape using web scraping and sentiment analysis. Through this magical little coding quest, I set out to explore the emotional world of one of Hogwarts' most complex characters and discover the enchanted words that shaped his story.

ðŸ“œ Chapter 1: The Sorcery of Web Scraping
To gather Snapeâ€™s tale, I turned to the wizardry of web scraping think of it like sending an enchanted owl to fetch pages from a secret archive. Using spells like BeautifulSoup and NLTK, I extracted his story from the web and turned it into a tidy little scroll (or, well... a CSV file).

ðŸ§ª Chapter 2: The Potion for Sentiment Analysis
This is where the real magic kicked in! With the help of SentimentIntensityAnalyzer, I brewed a potion to capture Snapeâ€™s feelings labeling them with emotions like angry, protective, and contemptuous. The result? A layered emotional map showing the shadows and sparks within Snapeâ€™s journey.

ðŸ”® Chapter 3: Discovering the Most Magical Words
Next, I summoned the most echoed words from Snapeâ€™s digital world. Filtering out the dull, everyday stuff and lemmatizing like a pro, I revealed his most-used terms: Snape, Harry, Dumbledore, Voldemort, and, of course, Lily. It was like peeking into his mind and hearing the echoes of his deepest thoughts.

âœ¨ Key Insights
Snapeâ€™s Emotional Landscape
The sentiment spell unveiled a storm of emotions swirling beneath that dark cloak:
Worry topped the list at 22.51%.
Contempt (19.32%) and anger (14.94%) werenâ€™t far behind.
Protectiveness (10.06%) reminded us of the guardian behind the glare.
Other emotionsâ€”sarcasm, sacrifice, affection, ambiguityâ€”completed the picture.

â€˜Snapeâ€™ appeared 703 times.
Harry, Dumbledore, and Voldemort followed closely behind.
And Lily a whisper of love, loyalty, and pain.
ðŸ”š Conclusion
This wasnâ€™t just a coding projectâ€”it was like flipping through Snapeâ€™s personal journal. The numbers didnâ€™t just crunch; they told a story. Through scraping and sentiment, I uncovered the layers of a character weâ€™ve loved, feared, and maybe rolled our eyes at once or twice. Turns out, even the Half-Blood Prince wears his heart on his (data) sleeve.
